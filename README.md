Steps to Upload

    Create a GitHub Repository:
        Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
        Name it something like intro-to-data-science-python.

    Organize Your Files:
        Create folders for different topics (e.g., data_cleaning, visualization, machine_learning).
        Use clear and descriptive names for your scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

    Add Supporting Files:
        Include a .gitignore file (e.g., to exclude .DS_Store or unnecessary cache files).
        If applicable, add a requirements.txt file listing libraries your code depends on.

    Upload Files:
        Clone the repository to your local machine and push the files using Git commands, or use the GitHub web interface to upload files.
